# 🦴 Skulls & Strategies: A Chronological Chronicle of Global Warfare

> “Before the gods of war, we were simply human—then we learned to bury our dead with their wounds still fresh.”

Welcome to **Skulls & Strategies**, an ambitious project dedicated to building the **most exhaustive, chronological, and cross-cultural archive of warfare in human history**—from **13,000 BCE** to the **modern era**.

This isn't just a military history blog. It's a **time machine, cultural atlas, and anthropological lens**, chronicling the **strategies, skirmishes, weapons, and worldviews** of every known people—extinct or extant—who ever took up arms.

## 🧠 What Is This Project?

**Skulls & Strategies** is a longform, research-driven blog and open-source archive aiming to answer questions like:

- When did humans first kill in organized groups?
- What do mass graves in Nubia and burned cities in Mesopotamia tell us about ancient geopolitics?
- How did the steppe peoples reshape Eurasia with horses and bows?
- Why did West African kingdoms like Oyo or Dahomey develop martial institutions as sophisticated as Sparta?
- What do battle maps, bronze weapons, or wooden palisades tell us about a society’s values?

## 💡 Vision & Philosophy

> “War is not a glitch in the human story. It *is* the story—unless we choose to understand it differently.”

This project:
- Refuses to reduce history to European empires
- Honors the tactical intelligence of underrepresented societies
- Recognizes the human cost behind every strategy
- Explores the link between environment, scarcity, and violence

---

## 🚧 Status

**Actively building** the database. Current focus:
- Prehistoric & Bronze Age warfare entries
- Regional war traditions (Africa, Mesoamerica, Polynesia)
- Backend structure & media integration
